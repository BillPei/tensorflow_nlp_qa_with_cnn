Question Key,Question Text,Response,true_or_false1,What is a deductible?,A deductible is the amount you must pay before your insurance company begins to contribute to your expenses.,12,Understanding how deductibles work.,"Your plan's deductible works like your car insurance deductible. You are responsible for an initial part of the cost, after which your insurance company pitches in.At the start of each benefit year, you are responsible for paying the full cost of your expenses. Once you have met your plan's deductible, then your future share of the costs will be much lower, with your plan picking up the bulk of those costs.",13,What is my medical plan deductible?,"The In-Network deductible for your medical plan (Alpha HSA) has a family deductible of $2,000. But your plan may start paying coinsurance sooner for you. ",14,How does my medical plan deductible work?,"The In-Network family deductible for your medical plan (Alpha HSA) is $2,000. Once you and your family have met this deductible, the insurance company will then pay for a portion of your qualified medical expenses. But there's another way that your medical expenses may be covered sooner with your plan. If any member of your family pays a total of $1,000 of medical expenses before you've paid down your $2,000 family deductible, then Alpha will begin paying for a portion of that member's covered medical services. This is referred to as an ""embedded deductible"".",16,What is the difference between an embedded and an aggregate deductible?,"Your medical plan (Alpha HSA) has an embedded deductible. Here is how it works. When you have family coverage with an embedded deductible, there are two ways you can meet your deductible so your insurance will start contributing toward a portion of your covered expenses. The first way is that you and your family members all use and pay for health care services. The combined total of those expenses reaches the deductible. The second way is that each family member accumulates expenses for their own portion of the deductible. Once one family member reaches their individual deductible, which is embedded in the family deductible, your insurance will start contributing toward a portion of that family member's covered expenses. While having an embedded deductible sounds complicated, it actually works to provide better coverage for individual members of your family. Once each family member meets his or her embedded deductible, insurance will start contributing toward a portion of that family member's covered expenses, regardless of whether the larger family deductible is met.Some medical plans have an aggregate deductible. While this doesn't apply to your plan, here's a description of how it works.When you have family coverage, an aggregate deductible is the combined deductible that must be met for the entire family. As each member of your family uses and pays for health care services, the amount they pay is credited toward the family‰Ûªs deductible. The combined total of those expenses reaches the deductible. The health plan then begins to pay a portion of the health care expenses for covered services of the entire family.",18,What is medical preventive care?,"Your medical plan (Alpha HSA) includes preventive care, at no cost to you.
